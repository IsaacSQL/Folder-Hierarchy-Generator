# Description
This is a simple script to create large folder hierarchies that I have found are useful in space management, but time-consuming to create through traditional means.
# Instruction
The program takes user input to generate folders.
Parent directory refers to the folder that holds your main folder. The simplest method is to navigate to your folder of choice, (such as your documents folder) by clicking on the navigation bar and copying the address. In my case, the pasted input would look like this /home/isaac/Documents/.
Next is the main folder. This will contain your folder hierarchy, E.g. YTVideos, Anime library, Blender3D.
Next, specify how many subfolders should be created. This is the number of unique folders inside your main folder, E.g. YTadventure, Naruto, Blender Doughnut.
Then, specify the number of shared folders inside the sub-folders. These will occupy all sub-folders and represent non-unique folders in each unique folder, E.g. YTSFX, Season1, Textures.
Finally, you will be prompted to name your shared folders, followed by naming your sub-folders. The console will print which one you are naming.
# Adding to an existing hierarchy
It is possible to add more folders and/or sub-folders to an existing folder hierarchy. It is easy to add an additional sub-folder. Simply follow the above steps, specifying the number of new sub-folders you want to create but the same number of shared folders. Name the shared folders the same as the existing folders and enter your new sub-folder names to add.
Adding shared folders is very similar. specify the same directory and parent folder as well as the number of sub-folders. Again, shared folders should be the number of folders to add.
